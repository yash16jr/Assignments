    "The close() function is used to close an open file in Python. When you are done reading from or writing to a file, you need to close it so that the operating system can release any resources associated with the file and so that other programs can access the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Closing a file is important for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Releases resources: When a file is open, the operating system allocates resources, such as memory, to the file. If the file is not closed, those resources remain allocated even after you have finished using the file. Closing the file releases those resources back to the operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Prevents data loss: If a file is not closed properly, the contents of the file may not be flushed to disk. This means that any changes you made to the file may be lost if the program terminates or the system crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Ensures data integrity: If multiple programs are trying to access the same file at the same time, it's possible that the data in the file may become corrupted. Closing a file ensures that the data in the file is consistent and that any changes are saved properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Increases system performance: If too many files are open at the same time, the system can become slow and unresponsive. Closing files when they are no longer needed helps to keep the number of open files to a minimum, which can improve system performance."
