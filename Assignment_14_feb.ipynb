By using multiple threads, the program can perform these tasks in parallel, which can reduce the total execution time and make the program more responsive.\n",

    "join(): This function is used to wait for a thread to complete its execution.

    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved performance: Multithreading can improve the performance of a program by allowing different parts of the code to execute concurrently on multiple cores of a CPU. This can lead to faster execution and increased throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "Responsiveness: Multithreading can help a program remain responsive to user input even while it performs background processing. For example, a graphical user interface (GUI) can use one thread to handle user input and another thread to perform computations in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource sharing: Multithreading can allow multiple threads to share resources such as memory and I/O devices more efficiently than if each thread had to access these resources exclusively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: Multithreading can help a program scale to handle larger workloads by allowing more threads to be created to handle more tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: Multithreading can add significant complexity to a program. Writing code that correctly synchronizes and coordinates access to shared resources can be difficult, and debugging threading issues can be challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Synchronization overhead: When multiple threads access shared resources, they must be synchronized to ensure that they do not interfere with each other. This synchronization can add overhead to the program and may reduce its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race conditions: Multithreading can introduce race conditions, which occur when two or more threads access shared resources in an unpredictable order. This can lead to unexpected and hard-to-debug errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlocks: Deadlocks can occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a shared resource. This can lead to a situation where the program stops responding and must be terminated."

    "Deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked waiting for each other to release resources that they are holding. In other words, each thread is waiting for a resource that is held by another thread, resulting in a situation where neither thread can proceed. Deadlocks can be very difficult to detect and resolve, and they can cause a program to become unresponsive or crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race conditions occur when two or more threads access shared resources in an unpredictable order. This can lead to unexpected behavior and hard-to-debug errors. For example, if two threads try to update the same variable at the same time, the final value of the variable may be different from what either thread intended. To prevent race conditions, it is important to synchronize access to shared resources using techniques such as locks or semaphores."
